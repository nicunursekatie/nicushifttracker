## Privacy & HIPAA Compliance

**IMPORTANT:** This app is designed for **DE-IDENTIFIED** patient information only.

- ❌ DO NOT enter patient names
- ❌ DO NOT enter exact dates of birth
- ❌ DO NOT enter medical record numbers
- ✅ DO use internal IDs, nicknames, or room/bed numbers
- ✅ DO calculate ages (PNA, GA, CGA) without storing DOB
- ✅ DO add full PHI only when transferring to official hospital charting systems

The app uses Firebase for data storage. All data is stored per-user and not shared between users.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React 18
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Backend/Database:** Firebase (Firestore + Authentication)
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **Deployment:** Can be deployed to Firebase Hosting, Vercel, Netlify, or any static hosting service

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- A Firebase account (free tier is sufficient for personal use)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd nicushifttracker
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Firebase

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Create a new project (or use an existing one)
3. Enable **Firestore Database**:
   - Go to Firestore Database
   - Create database in production mode
   - Choose a location close to you
4. Enable **Authentication**:
   - Go to Authentication
   - Enable "Anonymous" sign-in method
5. Get your Firebase configuration:
   - Go to Project Settings > General
   - Scroll to "Your apps" section
   - Click "Web app" (</>) icon
   - Copy the config object

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` and add your Firebase configuration:
   ```env
   VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key
   VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-project.firebaseapp.com
   VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
   VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-project.appspot.com
   VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-sender-id
   VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-app-id
   ```

### 5. Update Firebase Config in Code (Alternative Method)

If you prefer to configure Firebase directly in code (for Canvas or similar environments):

Edit `src/App.jsx` and update the Firebase initialization section (lines 8-11) to use your config directly or environment variables.

### 6. Set Up Firestore Security Rules

In Firebase Console > Firestore Database > Rules, add these rules:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow each user to read/write only their own data
    match /artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId}/{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
```

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`
